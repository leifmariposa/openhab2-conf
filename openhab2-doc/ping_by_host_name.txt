----------
If you’re running a Windows machine that does not have iTunes installed (which would have installed a
companion Bonjour client for mDNS resolution), you can resolve the lack of native mDNS support by
downloading Apple’s Bonjour Printer Service helper app here. Although the download page makes it sound
like it’s a printer-only tool, it effectively adds mDNS/Bonjour support across the board to Windows.
